# Steganography

## Overview
This lab assignment explores the use of various steganographic tools to hide, reveal, and detect data. You'll be using applications like S-Tools and Invisible Secrets to perform steganography on various file types. The objective is to understand the subtleties and effectiveness of steganographic techniques.

## Steps and Required Screenshots for Ex5 Submission

### Part A: Using S-Tools
- **Initial Setup**: Use S-Tools to hide a message inside a .bmp file.
- **File Properties Comparison**:
  - Observe and compare the properties of the original and modified .bmp file.
  - **Screenshot 1**: Capture the properties of both the original and modified .bmp files in the Ex5 folder. This demonstrates the impact of steganography on file properties.

### Part B: Using Invisible Secrets
- **Hiding and Encrypting Data**: Use Invisible Secrets to hide and encrypt a message in a different file type.
- **Reveal Hidden Data**:
  - Use the reveal function in S-Tools to show the hidden message.
  - **Screenshot 2**: Capture the Ex5 Submission file showing the revealed archive from the .bmp file.
